                                <p>I am a husband, and father to 5 beautiful children (Elijah, Nyla, Zoey, Brandon and Raine). I have worked in the title insurance industry for the past 20 years. I am a title specialist, with a keen eye for detail. With my ability to pay attention to the most minuscule details, it has given me the unique position to excel in my industry. I have taken this unique ability, and decided to apply it to software development. I have generated so much success in spotting deficiencies, that my cohort coaches and fellows have given me the nickname “Hawkeye”. Like the Avenger, with the same name, I consider myself to be a regular person, with an exceptional eye for detail.</p>

                                <p>I am a Pursuit fellow with a background in nonprofits who transitioned into software engineering out of a desire to automate tasks. I bring skills in database management, event planning, grant writing, fundraising, and development, all focused on furthering nonprofit missions. I am passionate about staying relevant and am currently expanding my knowledge in computer science.</p>

                                <p>I have been a self-taught software engineer for the last four years now. With a background in Audio-visual programming and project management, I love learning new cutting edge technology and applying it to a consumer-focused application.</p>
